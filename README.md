# ABR-Data
The ABR data were collected using the SmartEP system (Intelligent Hearing System, USA) in an acoustically attenuated and electromagnetically shielded environment. Click stimuli were presented at a rate of 19.1 stimuli per second, with intensity measured in dB nHL. Recordings were performed by trained professionals with expertise in evoked potential acquisition. Electrode placement followed the international 10-20 system, with the active electrode located at Cz, reference electrodes positioned on the left and right mastoids (A1 and A2), and the ground electrode on the forehead. The amplifier gain was set to 100,000, with a high-pass filter at 100 Hz, a low-pass filter at 3000 Hz, and an activated line filter. The artifact rejection threshold was ±31.0 μV, with a rejection window of 1.0-10.0 ms. Each recording included 1024 stimulus repetitions (sweeps). The recording was considered complete when a clear and replicable wave V was observed, or automatically terminated after 1024 sweeps if no repeatable waveform was detected. The classification of children hearing loss severity was performed by audiology professionals with relevant clinical experience. Manual peak marking of wave V was conducted to ensure labeling accuracy during the process.

This study included a total of 1024 subjects, with both left and right ears exposed to click sound stimuli ranging from 10 to 100 dB in 10 dB increments, resulting in 8694 ABR recordings. Among the participants, there were 665 males and 359 females, aged between 0 and 17 years (mean age: 2.45 ± 2.96 years). Based on hearing response thresholds, 5023 ABR recordings fell within the normal hearing response threshold
range, 1739 within the mild hearing response threshold range, 1049 within the moderate hearing response threshold range, 464 within the severe hearing response threshold range, and 419 within the profound hearing response threshold range. To meet different experimental needs, the dataset was organized into two classification tasks. In the binary classification task, 5023 recordings were labeled as normal, while the remaining 3671 recordings, which correspond to mild, moderate, severe, and profound hearing loss cases, were labeled as abnormal. In the multi-class classification task, all ABR recordings were categorized into five distinct classes: normal, mild, moderate, severe, and profound. This design enables fine-grained recognition of auditory threshold levels, as detailed in Table II. Each ABR recording spans from –13.675 ms to 11.900 ms, where 0 ms corresponds to the moment of sound stimulus onset, with a total of 1024 sampling points at a sampling frequency of 40 kHz. The analysis focused on the 0 ms to 11.500 ms time window. The hearing response thresholds for each subject were annotated by two experienced audiologists. All experimental protocols were approved by the Ethics Committee of Shenzhen Children’s Hospital (2022133).
